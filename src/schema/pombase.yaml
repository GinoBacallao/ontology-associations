    range: Database_name_enum
    description: The database that produced the file – included to facilitate data sharing with other databases. Obviously always PomBase for this file.
    examples:
      - value: PomBase
  Gene systematic ID:
    is_a: local id
    description: The systematic ID for each gene.
    range: string
    examples:
      - value: SPBC1773.02c
  FYPO ID:
    is_a: ontology class ref
    description: To use the FYPO IDs, see the [FYPO summary page](https://www.pombase.org/browse-curation/fission-yeast-phenotype-ontology) and the FAQ on browsing FYPO.    
    range: FYPO identifier
    examples:
      - value: FYPO:0001164
  Allele description:
    range: string
    description: The allele description specifically describes the change; see the Phenotype data bulk upload format for details on allele types and descriptions.    
    examples:
      - value: G126D
  Expression:
    range: Expression_enum
    description: >-
      The Expression column contains one of these values: ‘overexpression’, ‘knockdown’, ‘endogenous’, ‘null’, ‘not specified’. Deletions always have ‘null’ expression.
    examples:
      - value: Overexpression
  Parental strain:
    range: string
    description: >-
      The Parental strain column is for the parental strain designation, such as 972 h-, 975 h+, etc. This column must be filled in, but “unknown” is allowed.
    examples:
      - value: 972 h-
  Strain name (background):
    range: string
    description: The Background strain name column is used for a lab’s in-house name/ID/designation for the background strain (i.e. the derivative of the parental strain that has selectable marker alleles etc.). The description in the Genotype column should match this background strain.
  Genotype description:
    range: string
    description: The Background genotype description column is for alleles in the background, such as selectable markers; these details are optional. To avoid redundancy, it does not repeat the allele of interest (from column 4 or 10) in the genotype column.
  Gene name:
    range: string
    description: Gene names are optional for upload, but are included where available in the download.
    examples:
      - value: bcp1
  Allele name:
    range: string
    description: Allele names are optional for upload, but are included where available in the download. Column 10 lists the preferred allele name, and any alternative names are in column 11.
    examples:
      - value: bcp1+
  Allele synonym:
    range: string
    description: See note on Allele name above. Multiple entries are separated with pipes (|).
  Allele type:
    range: Allele_type_enum
    description: >-
      Allowed allele types, example descriptions, etc. are shown in the table at the bottom of the [Phenotype data bulk upload](https://www.pombase.org/documentation/phenotype-data-bulk-upload-format) format page.
    examples:
      - value: wild_type
  Evidence:
    is_a: evidence type
    description: >-
      For the Evidence column, we use a small selection from the Evidence Ontology (ECO). Please contact the Helpdesk if you need assistance using these IDs
    range: Evidence_enum
    examples:
      - value: cell growth assay evidence
  Condition:
    range: PECO identifier
    description: >-
      Conditions use a small ontology maintained in-house by PomBase curators, and we can help you interpret the IDs. Multiple entries are shown in cases where more than one condition detail applies at the same time (e.g. high temperature, minimal medium), and are separated with commas (,).
    examples:
      - value: PECO:0000126,PECO:0000102
  Penetrance:
    range: string
    description: >-
      Penetrance describes the proportion of a population that shows a cell-level phenotype. Penetrance data are represented as percents or entries from the in-house FYPO_EXT ontology (FYPO_EXT:0000001 = high; FYPO_EXT:0000002 = medium; FYPO_EXT:0000003 = low; FYPO_EXT:0000004 = full).

    examples:
      - value: FYPO_EXT:0000002
  Severity:
    range: FYPO_EXT identifier
    description: >-
      Severity (formerly designated “expressivity”) uses the FYPO_EXT ontology described in description of [Penetrance](Penetrance.md)
    examples:
      - value: FYPO_EXT:0000001
  Extension:
    range: string
    is_a: annotation extensions
    description: >-
      The Extension column is used to record when a mutation in one gene affects another gene or its product. For example, if a mutation in gene A decreases its ability to phosphorylate protein B, the A allele is annotated to the phenotype “decreased protein kinase activity” with the ID for gene B in an extension. In the downloadable file, an annotation can have multiple comma-separated extensions if they combine to form a “compound” extension (e.g. two or more genes assayed together).
    examples:
      - value: assayed_using(PomBase:SPBC11B10.09)
  Reference:
    is_a: supporting references
    description: >-
      The Reference column has the publication’s PubMed ID (PMID).
    range: publication
    examples:
      - value: PMID:19229492
  Taxon:
    is_a: db object taxon
    description: >-
      The taxon will usually be 4896 (the NCBI taxon ID for Schizosaccharomyces pombe), although an NCBI taxon ID for a specific S. pombe strain would be allowed.
    range: integer
    examples:
      - value: '4896'
  Date:
    is_a: annotation date
    description: >-
      The date is the date on which the annotations are created. Format: YYYY-MM-DD
